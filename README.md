Welcome to the SANAS AutoModel Car gitHub, this repository includes the codes used to navigate indoors and outdoors enviroments:
The next codes were used for the indoors navigation

- CMT (Visual GPS)   (Python).
- Lane_detect_Python (Pyhton).
- Heading_usr        (C++).
- Odometry_usr       (C++).
- Ocam_functions     (C++).
- rgbd_crop          (Python).
- control_xy         (C++).

For the outdoor navigation a Smartphone was used with an APP designed in APPInventor, however any application that sends magnetometer and GPS values through bluetooth works fine.
The next codes were used for the indoors navigation:

- cf_enu_conversion   (Python).
- bluetooth (Pyhton).
- Heading_usr        (C++).
- Odometry_usr_gps       (C++).


Originally ROS Indigo was used (master branch) but exist the ROS Kinect version. Wait for it!

**The instructions for use is in development**
